## Purpose

To practice nested and chained decision-making using conditional and logical operators.

## Logic

• Input three numbers from the user.  
• Compare the first number with the other two using (n1 >= n2 && n1 >= n3).  
• If true, display that the first number is the biggest.  
• Otherwise, check if the second number is greater than or equal to the others.  
• If none of the above are true, the third number is the biggest.  

## Example Input/Output

Enter any 3 numbers: 10 25 7  
The second number 25 is the biggest number  

Enter any 3 numbers: 45 12 9     
The first number 45 is the biggest number  

Enter any 3 numbers: 5 20 40  
The third number 40 is the biggest number  

## Key Concepts Practiced

➤ Conditional statements (if, else if, else)  
➤ Logical operators (&&)  
➤ Relational operators (>=)  
➤ Real-world conditional programming
